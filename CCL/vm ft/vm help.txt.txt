Select the option Use an existing virtual hard disk file and locate the donwloaded VMDK image below and create VM.

Now we have to create a NAT Network so go to File -> Preferences -> Network -> Add a New NAT Network (Click on +)

Right click and edit the Network name and CIDR if needed. Example :

Name - My VMbox Network
CIDR - 172.168.2.0/24 and save the changes.
Repeat the process of launching the VM for 2 instances.

Now go to the setting, go to the network setting and change the adapter to NAT Network and and select the NAT Network you made ( in our case : My VMbox Network ) and click ok.

Launch the VM now.

Install the net-tools to know the IP's of the instance.

$ sudo apt install net-tools
$ sudo apt update
To know the IP address
$ ifconfig
Now the IP will be in the range of 172.168.2.*

 * - any number in the range of 1 to 254 (total 256 addresses)
Now create a file and write something into it.
$ touch tranfer.txt
$ nano transfer.txt
-> hey, How are you?
ctrl + X and save
Some Commands for Linux Based Distros:

ls - list all the files and directories
cat - show the content inside a file
scp - it will help us to copy files from one vm to other
cd - change directory
mkdir - make a new directory
touch - it makes a new file 
nano - nano is a editor inside linux os

If your file is on the VM with IP 172.168.2.4 and the second VM's IP is 172.168.2.5.

Tranfer the file using SCP

$ scp tranfer.txt vagrant@172.168.2.5:/home/vagrant
